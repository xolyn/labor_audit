product_mix,"the number of unique products completed in each year-month for each factory; year-month can be coded from the variable ""SI Month""."," This is to be calculated from the variable ""GBU (PPM)"" for each factory in ""data2"" dataset."
style_mix,count the number of unique styles in each year-month for each factory.,"This is to be calculated from the variable ""Style"" for each factory in data2 dataset."
order_batches,count the number of order batches in each year-month for each factory,"This is to be calculated from the variable ""Order#"" for each factory in data2 dataset."
order_quant,the total order quantity (in paires or pieces) in each year-month for each factory,"This is to be calculated from the variable ""Quantity"" for each factory in data2 dataset."
lead_timeim,"the weighted ideal lead time in each month for each factory; the weight for each lead time is the percentage of ""quantity"" for the particular order among the total order quantity in the month.",calculation: (lead_timei(1) x weight1) + (lead_timei(2) x weight2)…..
lead_timenm,the weighted buyer lead time in each month for each factory. ,weight and calculation are the same as above
lead_timecm,the weighted factory confirmed lead time in each month for each factory,weight and calculation are the same as above
,**The following three variables are to be calculated for each order in data2 (not for each month)**,
lead_timei,the number of days from release of order to ideal customer target ontime delivery for each order.,"Calculation with variables in data2: ""Customer Target XFD (CTXFD)""-""Release Date"""
lead_timen,the number of days from release of order to buyer requested delivery date for each order.,"Calculation with variables in data2: ""NB Requested XFD (NBRXFD)""-""Release Date"""
lead_timec,the number of days from release of order to factory confirmed delivery date for each order.,"Calculation with variables in data2: ""Orig Fact Cfm XFD (OCXFD)""-""Release Date"""
